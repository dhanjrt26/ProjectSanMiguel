                                <p class="cookieDescription">The Municipality was established in July 1961 by virtue of Executive Order No. 423 dated 14 March 1961.[6] Its mother town is the municipality of Trinidad which also was formerly barrio Ipil of the Municipality of Talibon. The seat of government in the San Miguel was formerly Cambangay Sur which was formerly a part of Talibon when the latter became a pueblo during the Spanish regime.</a>.</p>
                                <p class="cookieDescription">The place which is now the town site was one a forest area teeming with all kinds of games. The early years of American regime saw the migration of a handful of natives from Ipil which was settlement in the north along the Ipil River. The search for greener pastures brought more settlers into the area. The majority of these migrants originated from the municipality of Loon.</p>
